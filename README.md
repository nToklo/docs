# Welcome!

This documentation will guide you through the integration process with the nToklo platform, either as a plugin user or when going for an API integration.

## nToklo plugins
The plugins allow even non-technical administrators to leverage the nToklo recommendations platform with just a few simple installation steps.

Currently, we provide plugins for:

- [Magento](doc/plugin/magento.md)
- [Wordpress](doc/plugin/wordpress.md)
- [WooCommerce](doc/plugin/woo_commerce.md)

## API integration
If no plugin is available for your platform, you'll have to write some code to integrate with our API. It's more straightforward than you might think! The following sections will give you all the details:

1. [Getting Started](doc/api/getting_started.md)
2. [Basic Integration](doc/api/basic_integration.md)
3. [nToklo API](doc/api/api.md)
4. [POST-ing events](doc/api/js.md)
5. [Authentication](doc/api/auth.md)
6. [Support for Analytics](doc/api/analytics.md)

To render the application process even more simple, we created a library (or "connector"), available in the the most commonly used languages, that abstracts the communication process with the nToklo API:

- [PHP connector](doc/api/php_connector.md)
- [Python connector](doc/api/python_connector.md)


## Support
