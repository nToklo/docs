# FAQ

Q. I receive the warning `universalvariable is undefined` or `Missing nToklo API key. Requires variable assignment: _ntoklo_key`.

> A. Your `universal_variable` object and `_ntoklo_key` must be defined before the nToklo Javascript tag. Please refer documentation on [nToklo Javascript tag](js.md).

Q. I have installed the nToklo plugin, and placed a Recommendation widget. Why don't I see any recommendations?

> A. There must be enough user activity in order for nToklo to compute recommended products. Once there is enough user activity you should begin to see recommendations. New nToklo customers will also have to wait 24 hours before recommendations and charts are computed.
